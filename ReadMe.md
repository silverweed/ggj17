# Wavescape game

Wavescape was a game made for the Global Game Jam 2017.

The player has the control over a wave that the main character, a ion, rides.

The player can change amplitude, frequency and shape in order to allow the ion to get through each level

## Open sourcing

At the beginning, we had the intention to continue the development with the initial team.

As time passed, it became clear that this wasn't possible due to a general lack of time of the team members.

Since we all like the initial idea behind the game ( also won the local prize for "most inovative game idea" ), we thought that it is pointless to own an idea just to stop it from developing.

This is why we are releasing this repository as public, in case someone likes the game and wants to continue the development of it.

## Licensing

The project is now released with a license based on MIT, the only added clause is that somewhere in the credits in of your game, you must include a reference to the original project (https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/wavescape-0).

**The reference must be visible and accessible.**
